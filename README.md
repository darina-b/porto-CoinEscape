# INTRO: This game was developed as a project for my course in Advanced Python (MOOC-PROGRAMMING-2024).
# INITIAL TASK: Use Pygame to build a shooting game and use only the given images: coin, robot, monster, door.

# CODE BASICS: 
# The main idea was to build individual classes for Coin, Robot, Monster, Door, Text.
# These individual classes were then inherited by the main game class CoinEscape, which contained joined methods
# for handling all of the above classes in the game.

# GAME INSTRUCTIONS: 
# Once you press 'Run' button to run the code, the game starts. 
# You will see the screen with 12 coins and the door, into which you should shoot as many coins, as you can.
# Charging and shooting happens below the horizontal lines, everything above is out of your direct control.

# Click below the horizontal lines to charge your cursor with a coin from the pile and click again to release the coin 
# when you find the right moment for it. 
# Beware of the monsters and robots, your coin should not touch any of them on its way to the door. 
# If you hit a monster >> the door moves.
# If you hit a robot >> a new monster appears.

# CONTROL KEYS:
# start == <RUN> your code
# play == use cursor
# end == close the game window <X>

# Enjoy!
